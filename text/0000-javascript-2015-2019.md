# Summary

Adopt JavaScript 2015-2019 syntax supported natively by Node.js where appropriate.

## Basic example

An example of a library updated to leverage ES2015-2019 features can be seen here <https://github.com/vfile/vfile-message/pull/8>

## Motivation

There are two goals:
1. Easing contribution for new members
2. Allow for additional instrumentation and tooling

### Easing Contributing

The [State of JS survey 2019](https://2019.stateofjs.com/), indicates that 85-90% of JavaScript developers have used ES2015 features [[1]](https://2018.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/es6/), which holds consistent with the 2018 results where 86.3% indicated they had used it and would use it again [[2]](https://2018.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/es6/).

### Additional Instrumentation and Tooling

Tools like ESLint provide additional analysis for features using ES205-2019 syntax. [[3]](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/#ecmascript-6) [[4]](https://github.com/xjamundx/eslint-plugin-promise)

## Detailed design

Leverage ES2015+ features where applicable with Unified:
* [`class`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class) for representing classes
* [Default parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters) to represent default values
* [`let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) and [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) for block scoped variables
* [Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) where `this` cannot/should not be changed with [`.bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind)
* [Rest parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) for representing an arbitrary number of parameters ([arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments))
* [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) for values that may resolve later (already used in Unified)
* [Async Await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) syntax for Promises

Platform support for these features can be seen at:
* <https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6>
* <https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus>

The features listed above are supported on:
* Node 8, 10, and 12 LTS
* Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari

## Drawbacks

There are two main drawbacks:
1. Changes are primarily internal
2. Legacy support

### Changes are Primarily Internal

These changes would not change the public API of Unified, VFile, Remark, etc.
This would be a set of internal changes which could benefit maintainability long-term, but would not have an immediate benefit for downstream adopters.

### Legacy Support

While many browsers and all active release lines of Node support ES2015-ES2019.
Not all platforms do, Nod.js 4 and earlier, Internet Explorer browser, and [Rhino](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino) do not fully support ES2015. [[5]](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)
To continue use on these platforms code would need to be transpiled to ES5, using [Babel](https://babeljs.io), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), or a similar tool.

## Alternatives

What other designs have been considered?
What is the impact of not doing this?

## Adoption strategy

> If we implement this proposal, how will existing unified developers adopt it?

These changes would mostly be internal, most public APIs would be completely unchanged, APIs that do change, would likely have subtle changes.

Adoption of this would take a bottom up approach, starting at the lowest level dependencies (vfile, vfile-message, etc), working up to the shared libraries (unified, unified-engine, etc), then into the language specific tooling (remark, rehype, retext, redot, etc).

> Is this a breaking change?

This is open for debate since Unified does not have an explicit browser/Node support matrix.
These changes would be primarily non-breaking, we could mark them as breaking to communicate the implicit change in support matrix.

> Can we write a codemod?

There is an existing codemod that can help with this <https://github.com/lebab/lebab>

> Should we coordinate with other projects or libraries?

This would primarily be internal.

## Unresolved questions

- [ ] Would this be considered a breaking change?
